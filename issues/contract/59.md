# Issue 59: Optimize for bulk ticket purchases

### DESCRIPTION

> **Reduce friction for group bookings.** Buying tickets for 5 friends should not require 5 separate blockchain transactions. This issue refactors the payment logic to support batch purchases, allowing guests to buy multiple tickets in one go while correctly accounting for individual supply and pricing rules.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add a `quantity: u32`** argument to `process_payment`.
- [ ] **Perform a single token transfer** for `quantity * active_tier_price`.
- [ ] **Verify that the total quantity** does not exceed the remaining tier or event supply caps.
- [ ] **Generate batch payment records** so each individual ticket is accounted for in the guest registry.

**Depends on:**

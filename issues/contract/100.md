# Issue 100: Protocol Launch and Governance Handover

### DESCRIPTION

> **The final step in the Agora decentralization journey.** This issue is the official "Switch" that moves the protocol from developer control to community control. It involves the final transaction that updates the contract administrator to the Agora DAO address.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Verify that all 99 previous issues** are completed and tested.
- [ ] **Execute the final `update_admin` call** to transfer control to the Multi-sig/DAO wallet.
- [ ] **Revoke all temporary developer keys** to ensure the protocol is fully independent.
- [ ] **Emit the `AgoraLaunch` event**, signaling the protocol is live for public use.

**Depends on:**

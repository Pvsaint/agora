# Issue 65: Implement mass refund logic for organizers

### DESCRIPTION

> **Organizers must be able to handle event cancellations gracefully.** If an event cannot proceed, the organizer needs to return all guest funds. This issue implements a batch processing logic for mass refunds, ensuring that even events with thousands of guests can be settled quickly.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Create a `trigger_bulk_refund` entry point** available only to the organizer.
- [ ] **Iterate through all confirmed payments** for the given event ID.
- [ ] **Transfer tokens from the contract escrow** back to each unique guest address.
- [ ] **Implement a storage-optimized loop** that processes refunds in batches to avoid network timeout limits.

**Depends on:**

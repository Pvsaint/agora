# Issue 51: Implement tiered pricing logic in Registry

### DESCRIPTION

> **One size does not fit all in event management.** Organizers require the flexibility to define multiple ticket types (General, Reserved, VIP) each with its own price point and supply limit. This issue refactors the registry to support complex, multi-tiered pricing models.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Define a `TicketTier` struct** with fields for `name: String`, `price: i128`, and `tier_limit: i128`.
- [ ] **Store tiers as a `Map<String, TicketTier>`** within the `EventInfo` record.
- [ ] **Update the search/getter functions** to return tiered pricing data to the Payment contract.
- [ ] **Implement validation** to ensure the sum of all `tier_limit` values does not exceed the event's global `max_supply`.

**Depends on:**

# Issue 48: Implement ticket inventory management in Event Registry

### DESCRIPTION

> **Scarcity is a core feature for event organizers.** We need a decentralized way to track how many tickets have been sold and prevent over-booking. This issue expands the `EventInfo` structure to include `max_supply` and `current_supply` fields, essentially turning the registry into a real-time inventory counter.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add `max_supply: i128`** to the `EventInfo` struct in `types.rs`.
- [ ] **Add `current_supply: i128`** to track the total successful purchases.
- [ ] **Implement an `increment_inventory` function** in the Registry that is restricted to calls from the `TicketPayment` contract.
- [ ] **Ensure data consistency** by using `env.storage().persistent()` to prevent inventory data from being cleared during ledger expiration.

**Depends on:**

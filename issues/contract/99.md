# Issue 99: Final Security Audit Trail Consolidation

### DESCRIPTION

> **Trust but verify.** This issue focuses on consolidating all the logs from unit tests, integration tests, and formal verification into a single, public 'Security Repository' that guests and organizers can review before trusting their funds to the contract.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Package all test results** into a standardized report format.
- [ ] **Generate a 'Security Score'** based on code coverage and passing audit passes.
- [ ] **Publish the verified WASM hashes** to a public registry (like Soroban's contract explorer) to ensure guests are interacting with the audited code.
- [ ] **Create an 'Audit Verification Guide'** for technical users to run the tests themselves.

**Depends on:**

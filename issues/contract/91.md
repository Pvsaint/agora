# Issue 91: Implement Waitlist & Escrow Commitment

### DESCRIPTION

> **Capitalize on high demand for sold-out events.** guests should be able to join an on-chain waitlist by pre-committing their funds to escrow. If a ticket becomes available (due to a refund or supply increase), the first guest in the queue is automatically sold the ticket.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Create a `WaitlistEntry` queue** for each `event_id`.
- [ ] **Implement `join_waitlist`** which requires the user to transfer ticket funds into the contract escrow in advance.
- [ ] **Modify `request_guest_refund`** (#66) to immediately trigger a sale to the next guest in the waitlist if one exists.
- [ ] **Allow ‘Exit Waitlist’** for guests to reclaim their locked funds if they change their mind before a ticket is assigned.

**Depends on:**
#66

# Issue 72: Enhance Event Emission for Auditability

### DESCRIPTION

> **On-chain events are the source of truth for all modern dashboards.** This issue standardizes our event data structure to include all relevant context (Who, What, How Much, When) in a structured format, enabling seamless integration with block explorers and custom indexers.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Design a standardized `AgoraEvent` enum** for common occurrences.
- [ ] **Audit every `process_payment`, `claim`, and `transfer`** function to ensure an event is emitted on every state change.
- [ ] **Include transaction IDs** and old/new state values in status-change events.
- [ ] **Validate event data structures** against the latest Soroban SDK recommendations for indexability.

**Depends on:**
None

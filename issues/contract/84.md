# Issue 84: Implement Subscription & Pass Logic

### DESCRIPTION

> **For recurring events or festival series, guests may want to buy a 'Season Pass' rather than individual tickets.** This issue introduces subscription-style logic where a single payment grants the guest access to multiple `event_id` records registered within a specific 'Project' or 'Series'.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Create a `SeriesRegistry`** that groups multiple events under a single parent ID.
- [ ] **Implement `Pass` storage** that tracks attendance rights across the entire series.
- [ ] **Modify `check_in`** (#62) to verify if a guest holds an active series pass instead of just an individual ticket.
- [ ] **Implement 'Usage Limits'** (e.g., pass valid for 5 events out of 10) to prevent abuse.

**Depends on:**
#62

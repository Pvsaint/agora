# Issue 70: Support for Partial Refunds

### DESCRIPTION

> **Deliver high-quality service, even when things go wrong.** If an event feature is missing, an organizer might want to offer a 20% refund to all guests while still keeping the event active. This issue implements the mathematical and distribution logic for percentage-based returns.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add `issue_partial_refund`** callable by organizers.
- [ ] **Calculate the refund amount for every guest** based on their unique purchase price.
- [ ] **Distribute the partial tokens** and update the 'Remaining Escrow' tracker for the event.
- [ ] **Ensure platform fees** are not refunded during a partial guest payout unless manually triggered.

**Depends on:**

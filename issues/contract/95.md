# Issue 95: High-Concurrency Performance Stress Tests

### DESCRIPTION

> **Popular events (concerts, festivals) often see thousands of users trying to buy tickets in the same minute.** This issue focuses on creating a high-concurrency simulation suite to ensure that the Agora storage and inventory logic can handle massive transactional spikes without data corruption or excessive gas spikes.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Build a `stress_tester.rs` utility** that spawns hundreds of simulated buyers.
- [ ] **Benchmark the `increment_inventory`** performance under heavy load.
- [ ] **Analyze ledger contention** and optimize for the Stellar network's parallel execution capabilities.
- [ ] **Verify that the 'Sold Out' state** is enforced correctly even when transactions arrive in the same block.

**Depends on:**

# Issue 61: Implement milestone-based revenue release

### DESCRIPTION

> **Large-scale events need operating capital.** While escrow protects guests, it can starve organizers of cash for venue deposits. This issue introduces milestone-based releases, allowing organizers to claim a portion of their revenue at pre-defined sales stages.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Define a `MilestonePlan`** (e.g., 25% at 500 sales, 50% at 1000 sales).
- [ ] **Store the plan** in the Registry during event creation.
- [ ] **Modify `claim_revenue`** to permit partial withdrawals if the current sales count meets a milestone threshold.
- [ ] **Carefully track `total_withdrawn`** to ensure an organizer can never withdraw more than their net revenue share.

**Depends on:**

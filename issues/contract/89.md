# Issue 89: Implement Organizer Slashing Mechanism

### DESCRIPTION

> **Prevent fraud before it happens by requiring 'Skin in the Game'.** This issue allows the platform to 'Slash' (confiscate) an organizer's staked collateral if they are found guilty of fraudulent activity by the Jurors (Issue 88).

### TASKS

- [ ] **Link the Juror decision** (#88) to the staking storage (#86).
- [ ] **Implement `trigger_slash`** which moves the organizer's collateral into a community pool or a guest compensation fund.
- [ ] **Automatically downgrade** the organizer's reputation and blacklist them (#74).
- [ ] **Ensure the slashing amount** is proportional to the scale of the fraud detected.

**Depends on:**
#88

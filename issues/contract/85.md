# Issue 85: Implement On-chain Auctioning for VIP Tiers

### DESCRIPTION

> **High-demand items like front-row seats or backstage passes are best priced via market discovery.** This issue adds an auction mechanism where guests can bid for specific tiers. The funds are held in escrow, and only the winning bidder's funds are finalized, while others are automatically returned.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add `AuctionConfig`** to the `TicketTier` struct (Start Price, End Time, Min Increment).
- [ ] **Create a `place_bid` function** that escrow's a guest's higher bid and returns the previous bidder's funds instantly.
- [ ] **Implement `close_auction`** logic that finalizes the highest bidder as the ticket owner.
- [ ] **Ensure platform fees** are calculated based on the _final_ hammer price, not the starting price.

**Depends on:**

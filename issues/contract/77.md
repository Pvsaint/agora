# Issue 77: Implement 'Dispute Resolution' fund locking

### DESCRIPTION

> **Attendees deserve protection.** If an event is reported for serious issues (e.g., the venue doesn't exist), the admin must be able to lock the organizer's funds until a resolution is reached. This issue adds 'Dispute-Aware' logic to the revenue claim flow.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add a `dispute_status: bool` flag** to the registry.
- [ ] **Block all `claim_revenue` attempts** for an event while a dispute is active.
- [ ] **Enable an 'Admin Return' path**, where the platform team can manually trigger guest refunds from a disputed event's escrow.
- [ ] **Emit high-priority `DisputeOpened` events** for the transparency of all stakeholders.

**Depends on:**

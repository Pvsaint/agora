# Issue 66: Enable buyer-initiated refund requests

### DESCRIPTION

> **Guest peace of mind increases sales.** This issue allows guest to request their own refund from the escrow bucket if they can no longer attend. This must be governed by the organizer's 'Refund Window' to prevent last-minute cancellations.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Build a `request_guest_refund` function** for ticket holders.
- [ ] **Validate against the `refund_deadline`** stored in the Registry.
- [ ] **Deduct a 'Restocking Fee'** if specified by the organizer, returning the net amount to the guest.
- [ ] **Increment the available inventory** (#48) automatically once a seat is freed.

**Depends on:**

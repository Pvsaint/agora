# Issue 97: Generate Optimized Developer SDK Bindings

### DESCRIPTION

> **A contract is only useful if developers can easily build on it.** This issue involves using the Soroban CLI to generate high-performance, type-safe SDK bindings for Rust and JavaScript, enabling the frontend and mobile teams to integrate Agora without writing manual RPC calls.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Clean the contract interface** (remove unnecessary public functions) before generation.
- [ ] **Run `soroban contract bindings`** for both `TicketPayment` and `EventRegistry`.
- [ ] **Encapsulate common flows** (like `buy_ticket_with_auto_approve`) into helper functions within the TS/JS library.
- [ ] **Publish a 'Getting Started' guide** for third-party developers wanting to build specialized Agora frontends.

**Depends on:**
None

# Issue 98: Mainnet Deployment and Security Playbook

### DESCRIPTION

### TASKS

- [ ] **Create a `deploy_all.sh` script** that handles the sequential deployment and cross-contract initialization of both storage and logic.
- [ ] **Implement a 'Dry Run' check** on the public Futurenet to verify gas costs for the actual launch environment.
- [ ] **Securely document the Cold Wallet** backup procedures for the core administrative keys.

# Issue 68: Automatic refund trigger on event cancellation

### DESCRIPTION

> **Automation reduces the support load.** When an organizer officially cancels an event in the Registry, the Payment contract should notice the state change and immediately open a 'Self-Service Refund' portal for all ticket holders.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Listen for `EventCancelled` signals** or check the registry status during a guest refund call.
- [ ] **Enable `claim_automatic_refund`** so guests can pull their funds out without waiting for the organizer's mass refund script.
- [ ] **Block any further organizer payouts** once an event is in the `Cancelled` state.
- [ ] **Clear the escrow balance** once all guests have successfully claimed their returns.

**Depends on:**

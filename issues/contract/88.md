# Issue 88: Third-Party Dispute Resolution (Jurors)

### DESCRIPTION

> **Automated escrow is good, but complex disputes require human judgment.** This issue enables the platform to designate "Jurors" (independent third parties) who can review evidence of event fraud and trigger a refund even if the organizer disagrees.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Create a `JurorWhitelist`** in the Registry.
- [ ] **Implement `open_dispute_case`** where guests can submit evidence (hashed links).
- [ ] **Allow Jurors to vote** on a `Refund` vs `Disburse` outcome.
- [ ] **Reward Jurors** with a small portion of the platform fee for their active participation in resolution.

**Depends on:**

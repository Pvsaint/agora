# Issue 71: Optimize Storage for high-volume events

### DESCRIPTION

> **Scale Agora to thousands of events.** Large maps and vectors in Soroban persistent storage can lead to expensive ledger fees. This issue refactors our data storage to use a "sharded" or direct key-access pattern to ensure even massive events remain fast and cheap to manage.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Replace large `Vec` storage** with individual persistent entries for each guest.
- [ ] **Use composite keys** (e.g., `DataKey::Guest(Address, String)`) for O(1) lookups during transfers and refunds.
- [ ] **Implement an 'Event Sharding' index** to allow the platform to iterate through large guest lists in manageable chunks.
- [ ] **Perform a gas audit** to prove that O(1) access patterns significantly reduce transaction costs.

**Depends on:**

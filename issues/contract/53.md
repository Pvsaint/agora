# Issue 53: Implement Organizer revenue claim function

### DESCRIPTION

> **The goal of the escrow system is safe disbursement.** Organizers should only be able to access their earnings after the event has successfully taken place. This issue creates the 'Payout' logic that allows organizers to claim their specific portion of the escrowed funds once event completion is verified.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Define a `claim_revenue` entry point** that verifies the caller is the registered organizer for the event.
- [ ] **Check the `EventRegistry` status** to ensure the event is over or marked as `Completed`.
- [ ] **Execute the transfer** of the net revenue (Total - Fees) to the organizer's stored `payment_address`.
- [ ] **Prevent double-claims** by clearing the internal balance tracker for the event after a successful withdrawal.

**Depends on:**

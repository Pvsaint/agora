# Issue 60: Implement Minimum Goal (All-or-Nothing) logic

### DESCRIPTION

> **Crowdfunded events reduce financial risk for organizers.** Some events should only proceed if a minimum ticket count is reached. This issue adds 'Goal-Aware' logic where funds are held and only made available for claim if the sales target is hit before the deadline.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add `min_sales_target: i128`** and `target_deadline: u64` to the Registry.
- [ ] **Implement a check in `claim_revenue`** that blocks withdrawal if the target was not met by the deadline.
- [ ] **Enable automated global refunds** if the goal fails, allowing guests to pull their money back easily.
- [ ] **Record the 'Goal Met' status** in storage to lock the event into a guaranteed state.

**Depends on:**

# Issue 96: Formal Verification and Invariant Audit

### DESCRIPTION

> **Smart contracts are permanent; errors are not an option.** This issue involves performing a mathematical "Sanity Audit" of the contract's core financial logic to prove that the 'Escrow Balance' always equals the sum of individual guest and organizer shares.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Define 'Invariants'** (e.g., `Contract Balance >= Total Event Shares + Unclaimed Fees`).
- [ ] **Perform a manual proof** of the fee calculation logic (#54) across all edge cases (rounding, zero amounts).
- [ ] **Review the authorization hierarchy** to ensure no path exists where a non-admin can alter global platform state.
- [ ] **Audit math overflows** in the milestone release logic (#61).

**Depends on:**
#82

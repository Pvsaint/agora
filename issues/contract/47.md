# Issue 47: Support for multiple payment assets (whitelist system)

### DESCRIPTION

> **Agora's payment system should be asset-agnostic to support a global user base.** While USDC is the primary focus, we must be able to accept XLM, EURC, or other tokens as the ecosystem grows. This issue implements a whitelist for accepted token addresses to ensure that only verified and stable assets can be used for ticket purchases.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Implement a `TokenWhitelist` storage bucket** using a `Map<Address, bool>`.
- [ ] **Create `add_token` and `remove_token` admin functions** to manage the whitelist.
- [ ] **Refactor `process_payment`** to take an extra `token_address` argument and compare it against the whitelist.
- [ ] **Adjust decimal handling** logic to ensure fees are calculated correctly regardless of the asset's precision (e.g., 7 vs 9 decimals).
- [ ] **Test with multiple token simulations** to ensure the transfers are routed to the correct treasury/organizer wallets for each asset type.

**Depends on:**

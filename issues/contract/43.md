# Issue 43: Implement contract upgradeability for Payment contract

### DESCRIPTION

> **The Agora platform requires a robust upgrade mechanism to fix bugs and introduce new features without losing user data or contract funds.** This issue involves adding the standard Soroban upgrade pattern to the `TicketPayment` contract. By implementing this, we ensure that as the protocol evolves (e.g., adding new fee structures or token support), the same contract address and state remain valid for all existing events.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Implement an `upgrade` function** that takes a `new_wasm_hash` of the updated contract.
- [ ] **Enforce strict authorization** so only the designated contract administrator can trigger the logic change.
- [ ] **Utilize `env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)`** to perform the on-chain replacement.
- [ ] **Create comprehensive unit tests** that simulate an upgrade and verify that initialization addresses (USDC, Registry) are preserved.
- [ ] **Emit a `ContractUpgraded` event** containing the old and new WASM hashes for audit trails.

**Depends on:**
None

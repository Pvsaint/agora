# Issue 46: Integrate Event Registry lookup into TicketPayment

### DESCRIPTION

> **To eliminate hardcoded logic, the Payment contract must behave as a dynamic router.** It needs to pull the correct organizer payment address and fee configuration specifically for the event being paid for. This issue implements the cross-contract communication between `TicketPayment` and `EventRegistry`.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Import the `EventRegistryInterface`** (or use the `Client` generator) into the `TicketPayment` contract.
- [ ] **Update `process_payment`** to dynamically fetch `PaymentInfo` using the `event_id` provided by the buyer.
- [ ] **Verify the event status** (e.g., must be `Active`) via the registry before accepting any USDC from the buyer.
- [ ] **Add error handling** for `RegistryError::EventNotFound` to prevent the payment contract from panicking with unclear messages.

**Depends on:**

# Issue 67: Add 'Non-Refundable' ticket attribute

### DESCRIPTION

> **Differentiate between economy and premium tickets.** Some organizers sell non-refundable tickets at a discount. This issue implements a per-tier 'is_refundable' flag that allows the system to enforce strict "no refund" policies for specific guest cohorts.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add `is_refundable: bool`** to the `TicketTier` struct.
- [ ] **Check this flag** inside the `request_guest_refund` flow.
- [ ] **Override for Cancellation**: Ensure that even non-refundable tickets are returned if the **organizer** cancels the entire event (#65).
- [ ] **Update the Registry UI/Indexers** to clearly mark tiers that do not support buyer-initiated refunds.

**Depends on:**

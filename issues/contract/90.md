# Issue 90: Implement Storage TTL Automation

### DESCRIPTION

> **State bloat is a significant cost factor in Soroban.** This issue implements a proactive management system for storage 'Time To Live' (TTL), ensuring that active events have their storage extended while archived data is allowed to expire and be reclaimed by the network.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Integrate `env.storage().persistent().extend_ttl(...)`** into all guest-facing and organizer-facing calls.
- [ ] **Define a standard 'Life Window'** (e.g., Event Date + 30 days) for persistent data.
- [ ] **Implement a `bump_ttl_bulk` function** for administrators to keep the core registry alive during periods of low activity.
- [ ] **Document the storage cost model** for organizers so they understand their "rent" obligations.

**Depends on:**

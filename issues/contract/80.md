# Issue 80: Develop end-to-end Integration Test suite

### DESCRIPTION

> **The ultimate stamp of quality.** Before any code goes to production, we must simulate the entire user journey at scale. This issue creates a comprehensive integration suite that tests the interaction between every module we've built.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Simulate a 'Full Platform Day'**: Registry Init -> Organizer Signup -> Event Creation -> Sales across 5 tiers -> Guest Refunding -> Organizer Claiming -> Admin Fee Withdrawal.
- [ ] **Test edge cases** like empty events, sold-out tiers, and failed token transfers.
- [ ] **Run concurrency tests** to ensure multiple guests buying simultaneously doesn't cause state corruption.
- [ ] **Generate a final 'Code Coverage' report** to ensure all logic paths are verified.

**Depends on:**
All functional issues

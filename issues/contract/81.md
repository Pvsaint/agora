# Issue 81: Final Gas Optimization Audit

### DESCRIPTION

> **Every stroke counts on the blockchain.** High transaction costs kill user adoption. This issue involves a deep technical optimization pass, refining our most-used functions to be as gas-efficient as possible for the Stellar network.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Profile `process_payment`** and remove any redundant storage reads or writes.
- [ ] **In-place state updates**: Optimize how we update `EventInfo` to minimize the bytes written back to the ledger.
- [ ] **Prune event logs**: Ensure we are not emitting excessive or repeated data in our audit logs.
- [ ] **Compare gas performance** against other major NFT/Ticket protocols on Soroban to ensure we are best-in-class.

**Depends on:**
None

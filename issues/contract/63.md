# Issue 63: Implement on-chain Ticket Transferability

### DESCRIPTION

> **Life happens, and guests sometimes need to give their ticket to a friend.** This issue implements ticket transfer logic, allowing a ticket owner to securely pass their seat to another address without involving centralized customer support.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Build the `transfer_ticket` function** that requires authorization from the current ticket holder.
- [ ] **Update the `buyer_address`** in the `Payment` struct and the associated storage indices.
- [ ] **Implement a 'Transfer Fee'** (optional, set by organizer) that is deducted during the process.
- [ ] **Ensure the transferee** becomes the rightful owner for all future refund or check-in operations.

**Depends on:**

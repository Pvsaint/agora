# Issue 69: Implement Event Postponement logic

### DESCRIPTION

> **Handle scheduling shifts fairly.** When an event is postponed, guests should have a limited time to decide if they can make the new date. This issue handles the transition from standard escrow to a temporary 'Refund Grace Period' for postponed events.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Implement a `Postponed` status** in the Registry.
- [ ] **Set a `grace_period_end` timestamp** when postponement occurs.
- [ ] **Allow all guests to refund** during this window, regardless of their original ticket's refundability status.
- [ ] **Lock the remaining funds** back into standard escrow after the grace period expires to secure the organizer's capital for the new date.

**Depends on:**

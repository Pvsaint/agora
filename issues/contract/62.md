# Issue 62: Support for 'Payment at Entry' verification

### DESCRIPTION

> **Bridge the gap between digital tickets and physical attendance.** Some events require a final on-chain handshake when the guest enters the venue. This issue implements a 'Check-In' flow that markers a ticket as used, potentially triggering the final release of funds from escrow.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add an `authorize_scanner` function** in the Registry to designate venue staff wallets.
- [ ] **Create a `check_in` entry point** in the Payment contract that only scanners can call.
- [ ] **Update the guest's record** to a `CheckedIn` status and log the arrival timestamp.
- [ ] **Prevent 'Double Check-In'** attacks by failing if the ticket is already marked as used.

**Depends on:**

# Issue 55: Add dynamic platform fee capability

### DESCRIPTION

> **Strategic partnerships require flexible fee structures.** We need to be able to set special fee rates for high-volume partners or charitable events. This issue implements a custom fee override in the Registry that takes precedence over the global platform default.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add `custom_fee_bps: Option<u32>`** to the `EventInfo` structure.
- [ ] **Implement `admin.set_custom_event_fee`** to allow the platform team to override the rate for specific event IDs.
- [ ] **Update the Payment contract** to check for this custom value during the `process_payment` and `claim_revenue` calculations.
- [ ] **Restrict fee overrides** to only be callable by the platform administrator (multi-sig).

**Depends on:**

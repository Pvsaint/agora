# Issue 50: Add IPFS metadata support for events

### DESCRIPTION

> **Storing rich data like images and long descriptions on-chain is prohibitively expensive.** The solution is to store a cryptographic hash (CID) of a metadata file stored on IPFS. This issue provides organizers with the ability to link their on-chain event record to its full decentralized content.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Include `metadata_cid: String`** in the `EventInfo` struct.
- [ ] **Support CID v1 format** validation to ensure standard IPFS links are used.
- [ ] **Add an `update_metadata` function** that allows organizers to point their event record to a new IPFS CID.
- [ ] **Emit `MetadataUpdated` events** to allow frontend indexers to refresh their cache of the event details.

**Depends on:**

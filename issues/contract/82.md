# Issue 82: Logic Sanitization and Security Hardening

### DESCRIPTION

> **Zero tolerance for bugs.** This final issue is for a manual "Sanity Pass." Reviewing every line for authorization, math safety (overflows), and logical consistency. It’s the final barrier before deployment to a public testnet.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Verify `require_auth`** is present on every function that can modify state or move funds.
- [ ] **Audit all `i128` arithmetic** to ensure no possibility of overflowing during large-volume fee calculations.
- [ ] **Check documentation** to ensure that public interfaces are clear and correctly described for external developers.
- [ ] **Ensure variable naming** is human-readable and standard across the entire suite.

**Depends on:**
All functional issues

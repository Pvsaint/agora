# Issue 94: Support for Gas Fee Abstraction (Paymasters)

### DESCRIPTION

> **Blockchain gas fees are a major barrier to entry for non-crypto users.** This issue allows an organizer or a sponsor to "Pay for Guest Gas" by implementing support for fee-bumps or a centralized 'Paymaster' allowance that covers the XLM costs for ticket purchases.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Implement a `SponsorBalance` map** where organizations can deposit XLM.
- [ ] **Add a `fee_bump_signature` validation** to allow guests to submit transactions with zero balance.
- [ ] **Deduct the gas cost** from the sponsor's contract balance upon successful transaction completion.
- [ ] **Restrict sponsorship** to specific events or tiers to prevent the sponsor fund from being drained by unrelated activity.

**Depends on:**

# Issue 44: Implement contract upgradeability for Event Registry

### DESCRIPTION

> **The `EventRegistry` is the backbone of the Agora platform, storing all event and organizer data.** It is critical that this contract can be upgraded to support richer event metadata or new registry features. This issue focuses on adding a secure upgrade path while guaranteeing that the persistent maps for events and organizers are never reset or corrupted during the migration.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Define the `upgrade` entry point** and protect it with `require_auth` on the `admin` address.
- [ ] **Implement state verification checks** to run post-upgrade, ensuring the `admin` and `platform_wallet` storage remains correct.
- [ ] **Add an audit log event** `RegistryUpgraded` that captures the timestamp and the administrator who signed the transaction.
- [ ] **Test the upgrade flow** with a dummy WASM hash to ensure the Soroban host environment accepts the update.

**Depends on:**
None

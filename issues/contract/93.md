# Issue 93: Implement Cross-Contract Plugin System (Hooks)

### DESCRIPTION

> **Agora should be an open ecosystem.** This issue introduces a "Hook" system where other Soroban contracts (e.g., an automated accounting dapp or a third-party loyalty program) can register to receive notifications whenever a specific event occurs on the Agora platform.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add a `HookRegistry`** that stores target contract addresses for specific event types (e.g., `on_purchase`).
- [ ] **Implement `register_hook`** with strict gas limits to prevent malicious plugins from breaking the core Agora transaction.
- [ ] **Trigger the cross-contract call** autonomously at the end of the `process_payment` and `check_in` flows.
- [ ] **Support 'Error Suppression'**: If a plugin fails, the core Agora transaction should still proceed to ensure user funds are never stuck.

**Depends on:**

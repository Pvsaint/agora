# Issue 75: Support for platform-wide promotional discounts

### DESCRIPTION

> **Drive platform adoption with seasonal sales.** This issue enables a 'Global Discount' feature where the platform admin can set a temporary discount rate that applies across every single event on Agora (e.g., Black Friday 15% off).

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add `global_promo_bps: u32`** and `promo_expiry: u64` to the contract state.
- [ ] **Incorporate this discount** into the `process_payment` price calculation.
- [ ] **Ensure the organizer's net share** is correctly derived from the final discounted price.
- [ ] **Add self-expiring logic** so the promo automatically turns off after the ledger timestamp passes the expiry.

**Depends on:**

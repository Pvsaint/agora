# Issue 73: Implement Emergency Stop (Circuit Breaker)

### DESCRIPTION

> **Protection against the unexpected.** In the event of a discovered vulnerability or a coordinated attack, the platform team must be able to "Pause" all contract activity immediately. This issue implements a global circuit breaker that locks all sensitive entry points while an investigation occurs.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add a persistent `is_paused` flag** to the contract configuration.
- [ ] **Insert a `require(!is_paused)` check** into all core functions (Payment, Claim, Refund, Transfer).
- [ ] **Implement `set_pause(bool)`** restricted to the multi-sig administrator.
- [ ] **Ensure that "Emergency Withdrawal"** (for the admin) or "Upgrades" remain possible even when the system is paused to allow for fixes.

**Depends on:**

# Issue 74: Implement Organizer Blacklist in Registry

### DESCRIPTION

> **Bad actors should not be able to interact with the protocol.** This issue adds a blacklist system to the Registry, allowing the platform team to block malicious organizers from creating new events or managing their existing funds if fraud is suspected.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Implement a `storage::is_blacklisted(Address)`** lookup.
- [ ] **Modify `register_event`** to fail if the organizer is on the blacklist.
- [ ] **Create admin functions** to manage the blacklist with mandatory audit logging for every addition or removal.
- [ ] **Add a 'Suspension' ripple effect**: All active events from a blacklisted organizer should be automatically moved to a `Locked` state.

**Depends on:**

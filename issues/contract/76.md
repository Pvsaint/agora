# Issue 76: Create Platform Revenue Reporting views

### DESCRIPTION

> **Management through data-driven insights.** The platform team needs to see the pulse of the protocol. This issue adds read-only getter functions that aggregate volume, fee collection, and active event counts across the whole contract suite.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Implement an internal `total_volume_processed` metric** that increments on every ticket sale.
- [ ] **Track `total_fees_collected`** on a per-token basis for easy treasury reporting.
- [ ] **Expose these metrics** via `read-only` contract functions that do not require gas for external querying.
- [ ] **Add an 'Active Escrow Total' view** to visualize the protocol's liquidity.

**Depends on:**

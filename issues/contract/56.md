# Issue 56: Implement Early Bird pricing duration

### DESCRIPTION

> **Early ticket sales create momentum.** This issue introduces time-sensitive pricing directly into the smart contract logic, allowing organizers to offer discounts that expire automatically after a certain date or when a specific number of tickets are sold.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Extend `TicketTier`** to include `early_bird_price: i128` and `early_bird_deadline: u64`.
- [ ] **Modify `process_payment`** to compare `env.ledger().timestamp()` against the deadline to determine the active price.
- [ ] **Implement a 'Price Switch' log** that records when a tier moves from Early Bird to Standard pricing.
- [ ] **Test edge cases**, such as a payment being submitted just seconds before the deadline expires.

**Depends on:**

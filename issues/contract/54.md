# Issue 54: Automated platform fee distribution

### DESCRIPTION

> **Revenue sharing should be seamless.** To ensure the platform remains sustainable, fees must be collected and moved to the treasury whenever an organizer claims their revenue. This issue automates the treasury funding process.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Update the `claim_revenue` function** to perform two transfers: net revenue to organizer and platform fee to `PlatformWallet`.
- [ ] **Calculate the fee dynamically** based on the basis points (bps) defined in the Registry (#55).
- [ ] **Add a safeguard** that ensures the platform fee transfer happens before the organizer's net transfer to prioritize treasury safety.
- [ ] **Emit a detailed `FeeSettled` event** for platform accounting.

**Depends on:**

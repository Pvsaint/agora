# Issue 64: Support for Resale Price Caps

### DESCRIPTION

> **Keep Agora a community-first platform.** To prevent malicious scalping, organizers should be able to cap the price for which a ticket can be 'resold' on-chain. This issue introduces price validation for transfers that involve a payment component.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add `resale_cap_bps`** to the Event Registry configuration.
- [ ] **Update `transfer_ticket`** to include an optional sale price.
- [ ] **Verify that the sale price** does not exceed `Original Price * (1 + resale_cap)`.
- [ ] **Block the transfer** if the price is too high, maintaining a fair secondary market.

**Depends on:**

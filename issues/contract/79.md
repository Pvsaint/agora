# Issue 79: Administrator Treasury withdrawal mechanism

### DESCRIPTION

> **Move fees from 'Managed' to 'Owned'.** This issue provides a secure gateway for the platform team to withdraw accumulated fees from the contract treasury into an external hot or cold wallet for operational use.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Build a `withdraw_platform_fees(amount, token_address)` entry point.**
- [ ] **Verify that the amount requested** is less than or equal to the recorded `total_fees_collected`.
- [ ] **Incorporate a 'Withdrawal Cap' per day** to mitigate impact in case of an admin key compromise.
- [ ] **Sign the transaction** with mandatory multi-sig authorization (#45).

**Depends on:**
#54

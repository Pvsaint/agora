# Issue 45: Add multi-signature admin support for treasury updates

### DESCRIPTION

> **Centralized control over a platform's treasury represents a single point of failure and a significant security risk.** This issue introduces a multi-step or multi-key authorization pattern for changing sensitive platform parameters (like the `platform_wallet` or the `admin` themselves). This is foundational for moving towards a decentralized governance model or a secure multi-sig team wallet.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Extend `DataKey`** to support a collection of administrator addresses or a threshold-based multi-sig struct.
- [ ] **Refactor `set_platform_wallet`** to require collective authorization before the state change is committed.
- [ ] **Implement an `add_admin` and `remove_admin` protocol** with safety checks to prevent locking the contract (e.g., must have at least one admin).
- [ ] **Support 'Proposed Change' states**, where a change is logged and awaits further signatures before activation.

**Depends on:**
None

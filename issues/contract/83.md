# Issue 83: Implement Oracle Integration for USD Pricing

### DESCRIPTION

> **Organizers often prefer to set prices in USD to maintain stable revenue, even when guests pay in volatile assets like XLM.** This issue integrates Soroban price feeds (Oracles) into the Payment contract, allowing the system to calculate the required amount of an asset in real-time based on a fixed USD ticket price.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Import an Oracle Client** (e.g., Band or custom provider) into the `TicketPayment` contract.
- [ ] **Add `usd_price: i128`** as an alternative pricing model in `TicketTier`.
- [ ] **Implement `get_asset_price`** to fetch the current asset/USD exchange rate during the purchase flow.
- [ ] **Apply a 'Slippage Buffer'** (e.g., 1-2%) to ensure transactions don't fail due to minor price fluctuations between signing and execution.

**Depends on:**

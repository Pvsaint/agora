# Issue 78: Add Organizer Self-Cleanup for archived events

### DESCRIPTION

> **Clean slate for organizers.** Once an event is settled and the money is claimed, some data is no longer needed on-chain. This issue allows organizers to archive their finished events, clearing non-critical storage to reclaim their storage deposits.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Implement the `archive_event` function** for settled event IDs.
- [ ] **Wipe non-essential event data** (Description, Tier list) to reduce the contract's overall storage footprint.
- [ ] **Maintain a minimal 'Receipt' record** (Total Sold, Organizer ID) for historical lookups.
- [ ] **Automate the reclaiming of XLM storage deposits** back to the organizer's wallet.

**Depends on:**

# Issue 86: Implement Loyalty & Staking System

### DESCRIPTION

> **Reward the most active members of the Agora community.** This issue introduces a loyalty points tracker (off-chain indexed but on-chain triggered) and a staking mechanism for organizers to "verify" their reputation by locking Agora tokens as collateral.

### TASKS

- [ ] **Add a `loyalty_score` field** to the Guest storage (Issue 71).
- [ ] **Implement `stake_collateral`** for organizers, locking a specific amount of assets to unlock 'Verified' status.
- [ ] **Automate interest/reward distribution** for stakers based on ticket sales volume.
- [ ] **Integrate loyalty discounts**: Guests with high scores automatically receive a percentage off their platform fees.

**Depends on:**
